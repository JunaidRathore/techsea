## Customization

### Theme

The application uses a custom Chakra UI theme that you can edit in the `src/theme` directory. Colors, fonts, and component styles can be adjusted to match your branding.

```typescript
// Example of theme customization in theme.ts
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    brand: {
      primary: "rgba(86, 59, 219, 1)",
      black: "rgba(16, 20, 25, 1)",
      sidebarBg: "rgba(249, 249, 249, 1)",
      // Add more custom colors here
    }
  },
  fonts: {
    body: "Geist, system-ui, sans-serif",
    heading: "Geist, system-ui, sans-serif"
  }
});

export default theme;
```

### Components

All components are built with Chakra UI and Framer Motion, making them highly customizable. You can adjust props, animations, and styling to match your requirements.

## Animation Guide

This project uses Framer Motion for animations. Here are some common patterns used:

### Entry Animations

Components animate in when they first mount using variants:

```tsx
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
      delayChildren: 0.2
    }
  }
};

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      type: "spring",
      damping: 12,
      stiffness: 100
    }
  }
};
```

### Hover and Tap Animations

Interactive elements have hover and tap animations:

```tsx
<MotionButton
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
  // other props
>
  Button Text
</MotionButton>
```

### Continuous Animations

Some elements have continuous animations to draw attention:

```tsx
<MotionBadge
  animate={{
    scale: [1, 1.05, 1],
    transition: {
      duration: 2,
      repeat: Infinity,
      repeatType: "reverse"
    }
  }}
  // other props
>
  Badge Content
</MotionBadge>
```
